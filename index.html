        <p>Welcome to VE6EVL's list of radio resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>As a new ham, the thing I found most challenging was the overwhelming volume of available information. I would dive in and quickly get lost.</p>
        <p>The intent of these pages is to try and provide some structure to that information, and once you've got the "NEED to know" stuff down, you can dive into other areas that may interest you.</p>
        <p>This is an ever-evolving list I'll add to as I find more "good stuff" that I think is helpful.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your journey! VE6EVL</p>
